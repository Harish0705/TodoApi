Learning Notes:

The Results and TypedResults static classes provide similar sets of results helpers. 
The TypedResults class is the typed equivalent of the Results class. However, the Results helpers' 
return type is IResult, while each TypedResults helper's return type is one of the 
IResult implementation types. The difference means that for Results helpers a conversion is needed 
when the concrete type is needed, for example, for unit testing. 
The implementation types are defined in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpResults namespace.

Returning TypedResults rather than Results has the following advantages:

TypedResults helpers return strongly typed objects, which can improve code readability, unit testing, 
and reduce the chance of runtime errors.
The implementation type automatically provides the response type metadata for OpenAPI to describe 
the endpoint.

Prevent over-posting:
Currently the sample app exposes the entire Todo object. Production apps In production applications, 
a subset of the model is often used to restrict the data that can be input and returned.
 There are multiple reasons behind this and security is a major one. The subset of a model is usually 
 referred to as a Data Transfer Object (DTO), input model, or view model. DTO is used in this article.

A DTO can be used to:

Prevent over-posting.
Hide properties that clients aren't supposed to view.
Omit some properties to reduce payload size.
Flatten object graphs that contain nested objects. Flattened object graphs can be more convenient for clients.
