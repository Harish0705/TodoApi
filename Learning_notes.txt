Learning Notes:

The Results and TypedResults static classes provide similar sets of results helpers. 
The TypedResults class is the typed equivalent of the Results class. However, the Results helpers' 
return type is IResult, while each TypedResults helper's return type is one of the 
IResult implementation types. The difference means that for Results helpers a conversion is needed 
when the concrete type is needed, for example, for unit testing. 
The implementation types are defined in the Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http.HttpResults namespace.

Returning TypedResults rather than Results has the following advantages:

TypedResults helpers return strongly typed objects, which can improve code readability, unit testing, 
and reduce the chance of runtime errors.
The implementation type automatically provides the response type metadata for OpenAPI to describe 
the endpoint.
